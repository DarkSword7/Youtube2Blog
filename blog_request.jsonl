      \n                            Video Title: We made MKBHD's Dream Phone\n                            Author: Nothing\n                            \n                            Transcript:\n                            We messaged MKBHD to find out what he would put into his dream smartphone in this video we're going to go through all the specs how much it would cost and we've even got concept Central to mock it up for us so let's get into it okay so for context Marquez answered the email and we consulted all of the experts here at nothing to work out what it would cost to make his dream phone we're going to reveal the final figure at the end of the video but I don't actually know what any of the figures are so I'm going to be learning about them as you do isn't that a fun little Quirk to the video so to start things off we're going to talk about bomb and if you watched our recent video with Tim our CFO you'll know that that stands for bill of materials basically the individual cost of each component in a smartphone we're going to cover everything we're going to start out cheap we're going to get more expensive throughout the video but strap in because things are going to get expensive real quick so firstly Marquez is going to need a big old battery and he's requested a 5800 Mah cell with fast and wireless charging other products that have this are the Rog phone 9 which boasts up to 22 hours of video streaming that's a long old session of watching video is it boy so a pretty beefy boy but I think we can go a bit better round it up to 6,000 mahs and apparently this is going to cost $13 per battery and actually I think that's probably slightly more than I was expecting right off the rip and for context phone 2's battery cost about $6 so uh I think we're off to an expensive start already before we go any deeper it's worth noting that these are just ballpark figures obviously different companies can negotiate different costs with their suppliers so just take every number with a grain of salt little okay onto the display Marquez has requested the same screen as the Samsung s24 Ultra and that is of course a 120 HZ ltpo with super bright AMOLED and anti-glare glass It also says it wants the device to be smaller at 6.1 in so that adds another $35 to the pot all right onto cameras Marquez knows these very well of course he has requested the hardware from the s24 ultra but the software from the iPhone 16 Pro so we're going to have to imagine that Apple and Samsung will put their differences aside for this product as for the specific cameras he's looking for these sensor and lens Combos and as for the front-facing camera we're going to use that for the pixel 9 Pro so let's add that to the device all right so alt together for camera Hardware we're looking at $80 added to the bill and for storage we're looking at add in 1 TB of flash memory but it doesn't specify which ufs generation he was looking for I'm guessing 4.0 that was a pretty nerdy question though I suppose and if we pair the storage with 16 gigs of RAM that takes the total price for these components to $90 and finally we need a chipset and for this Marquez has requested the Snapdragon 8 Elite this is typically found in gaming smartphones so we can expect this to add quite a lot to the final price without revealing our exact supplier costs a flagship processor typically goes somewhere in the realm of $190 so let's add that on I can't help but notice he's not requested any components from a nothing product here I just assume he's waiting for phone fre anyway there's a whole bunch of extra stuff we've not added on yet including electronic components packaging design materials stickers in the Box stickers in the box and if we round all of that together our final bomb cost comes to $500 [Music] [Music] and I know what you're thinking at this point in the video $500 for such a top tier phone well we're not finished yet so sit back down and we're going to cover some of the Hidden costs that go into smartphones cuz you know we're in the industry we can reveal some of this stuff so let's keep going as you can imagine all of those components we've just listed aren't going to Magic work together for example every phone has a motherboard that's made bespoke for its form factor and components inside it's not like a gaming PC where there's loads of space and everything just fits together in a modular fashion that would be way too easy and there wouldn't be any point in this section of the video no instead smartphone companies need to go through a whole bunch of research and development otherwise known as R&D so let's get into that the R&D process can apparently be quite costly with all manner of things including staff salaries software licenses manufacturing engineering and certifications these all add up if we were to B B this estimate on a recent nothing smartphone a typical R&D process can cost somewhere in the realm of 20 Mill 20 million okay all right so let's add that to the pop from earlier and we'll uh reveal the grand total at the end is it going to be 20,500 all right okay so at this point we took all of our research upstairs to the big man now I went into this meeting thinking yeah it was going to be cool he was going to say lovely research bro but cuz he talks like that all the time but sadly not he had a number of things that we had missed off and yeah we need to cover those too for example Marquez didn't specify which operating system he wanted to use he just said that he wanted to use the camera tuning from the iPhone 16 Pro if he wanted to build his own operating system he would need a team of 150 or more software Engineers plus you need to consider things like software support major Android updates over each year this is all going to add up and absolutely eat into your profits He also mentioned that if you're a new company factories won't trust you yet so you're going to have to pay Upfront for manufacturing this is going to cause some cash flow problems if you're an established brand you can get away with paying up to 3 months later and obviously that's going to be easy cuz you can sell phones in that time not to mention premium factories won't even touch you because it's too high risk for them and if this is your first piece of work with one of these factories it's going to cost you a premium of up to 15% more just because you haven't got an established relationship with them on the topic of cash you need to consider how much you can sell each device for as well and Marquez has requested a 6.1 in phone a bit smaller than typical and we have to charge more for this because smaller smartphones are just not as popular as big ones despite what ulot keep saying in our comment section so with all that said Carl ended his motivational speech with the words it's so we've decided to leave those additional costs off the list because it got a bit too much for us to be honest so on the topic of operating system we're going to throw in nothing OS for free because we're generous like that did you guys really think we were going to put color OS on this bad boy phone I don't think so mate okay so now that we have all of the numbers and KL has finished his motivational speech final figure to develop one of marquez's dream smartphone is 23, 535,000 $100 obviously that cost would come down with the more phones we sell but that's really beyond the scope of this video so if you want to hear more about producing consumer Tech why don't you watch this lovely video from Carl talking about the bom price of the iPhone 14\n                            \n                            Instructions:\n                            1.
